<p id="paradeus" style="color: #ffffff;">
    The sky was dark and gray, rain pouring heavily with streaks of lightning breaking through it every few dozens of seconds. <br>“Better weather than usual.” Mitemi muttered as he pulled his rifle over his shoulder. <br>
    He walked in a broken avenue of a city that had long since fallen. Ruins laid everywhere and so did the inhabitants in either death or a new form. Living people have become scarce for quite a while, the streets being empty. 
    <br><br>
    For those who remained, scavenging became a priority for everyone alike. After successfully completing a salvage mission in an abandoned factory to gather strange antibiotics , it was time to gather back with the rest of the crew. With every step closer to home, I could feel something wrong. I’ve seen some small glass fractures seemingly in the air out of nowhere and can sense another presence that shouldn’t be.
    While still feigning nonchalance about the whole thing, I kept my ears peeled on every little noise, trying to detect wherever that entity could be if it was there. I felt a chill run down my spine and a feeling of dread settle in me. 
    <br><br>
    The silenced sound of footsteps stopped abruptly right behind Mitemi. He slowly turned around to find a cloaked person standing right behind him, slashing a dagger in his face’s direction. The green-clad man gracefully dodged while unholstering his handgun in response. A gun’s barrel met the blade of a dagger mere centimetres apart.
    <br><br>
    “Good to see you again, Nat.”<br>
    “Long time no see, Mit.” A female voice e responded. Nat took off her hood, her black hair now into clear view. Her real name was Nicolle, but most people called her Nat. Her black eyes sparkled mischievously while she had a slightly smug smile. In fact, she looked downright confident in herself. She was a powerful fighter that couldn’t be taken down alone.<br>
    “What have you been doing lately? TUC hasn’t seen you recently.”<br>
    “Your agency doesn’t pay well enough. You should do better business, you know.” Nat teased as they both made their way through the wrecked city together.<br>
    “You do know you’re still apart of TUC until you actually resign, right?”<br>
    “I did take some far-away jobs from other agencies though.”<br>
    Nat stopped in her tracks after ending her sentence. I followed shortly after. <br>
    “Do you ever just feel dread before an actual chance at death?” Nat said after slowly pulling out two pistols.<br>
    “Isn’t that a natural feeling? Hostiles in every direction.”<br>
    I took my 416 from my back and charged it in preparation. Several bands of infected had surrounded us in every direction in a manner that would make even the Wehrmacht proud, although it would only be through bad luck. I clicked my glasses to activate a HUD which showed a visual map of our surroundings among other things. We were still several kilometres from destination.<br>
    “This won’t be our final night, I’ll leave everyone to the north to you, Nat.”<br>
    I expected a fast answer but instead she just… glitched out? That… doesn’t happen normally, but it was like the fractures I kept seeing. This is not the first time I’m here, but this is the first time things are breaking down along with memories. I had a feeling she wasn’t even supposed to be here, replacing someone else that should in fact be here.<br>
    “Let’s go.” she replied.<br>
    <br>
    Mitemi shot first, taking down a green husk instantly in the head before quickly dashing closer to two others and respectively stabbing and shooting at point blank range the two. This was a needlessly risky move but that awarded style nonetheless.
    Nicolle followed with taking down several ones with clean shots in the head, although some needed several more than others. A synergy of a sniper and assault person would have been great in this situation. 
    A loud boom echoed through the air.<br>
    “Was that an explosive trap going off?” Mitemi asked.<br>
    “I quickly set one earlier, looks like it might have paid off”<br>
    “Do you just set up traps in the middle of nowhere as a hobby?”<br>
    “I had an extra I couldn’t carry.”<br>
    After seeing the robustness of some of the bigger ones, they had moved from a quick offensive to conserving ammunition and resources. The only slight positive advantage over fleeing could be slightly more scavenging of dead bodies. Since the fungus could also infect autonomous androids, it was worth to salvage what could be useful electronics. Sadly, melee combat wasn’t favourable against them, making them high cost and high reward.
    <br><br>
    The last enemy was taken care of swiftly. <br>
    After quick scanning and salvage, the duo headed out while eating a snack.  They had come across a few abandoned warehouses with edible items inside of them and decided to loot for whatever food they might find. While digging through cases, they came upon a large box that seemed to contain old clothing, books and documents. One bag contained a book written in Ancient Chinese writing with some sort of symbols carved on it.
