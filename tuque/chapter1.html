<br><br>
“What?” 
<br><br>
I looked at the ethereal popup in front of me. This was confusing to say the least. I can’t even remember how I found myself in a seemingly infinite white void.
<br><br>
“Welcome to the In-Between.” a soft female voice said.<br>
I turned around to see a woman who seemed so familiar, but couldn’t quite put a finger on it until fragments of memories came back to me.
<br><br>
“Limoges? What are you doing here?”<br>
“Fear not, for this is a place not to provoke harm, but to feel at ease.”<br>
“That’s the wrong line from the wrong In-Betw-“<br>
“Welcome back, Mitemi. The pieces are in place for you.”
<br><br>
Limoges is a being resembling a young woman wearing some kind of maid outfit. Her golden eyes and hair were her main distinguishing traits, standing out with her blue and white clothes, all colours reminiscent of the old Ancien Regime of Bourbon France. She seemed to know more than me, although she looks like she expects me to know more than her. She’s holding an empty wineglass in her hands that I now realize she is slowly filling.
<br><br>
“Fancy a glass?”<br>
“I don’t drink.”<br>
“What a shame, not so elegant as you’d want yourself to be.”
<br><br>
Limoges played with the glass of wine in her hands, swirling it around before taking a sip. I didn’t really see why she had to play with her glass like that, but people are unique, I guess.
<br><br>
“You seem to be quite lost and confused about your situation. It isn’t uncommon for one that comes to the In‐Between, but this is something very unusual indeed for you of all people to be lost.”<br>
“What is that supposed to mean?”<br>
“How much do you remember?”<br>
“Not too much, how did I even get here?”<br>
“Ah, well that would probably require an explanation to go along with the story, but if you recall your journey from…”<br>
Limoges trailed off after her sentence, and I could tell something wasn’t right. Her face quickly changed to a pensive frown tilted in confusion.<br>
“Actually, you’ve probably been called because there’s an issue with the whole of Latuque.”
<br><br>
Limoges spawned an holographic-looking map from a wave of her hand. It clearly showed the whole of Mitemi’s known world, Latuque, inhabited by TUC, and an odd-looking empty void dotted with similarly empty dots filling the rest of the map. Latuque sat at the core of what could be known as the In-Between.
<br><br>
“Maybe you should re-experience your tale, starting from the beginning of time until it came crashing down. Surely you’ll be escape to escape fate with another attempt.”<br>
“Why do I need to relive everything again when we already know what happened?”<br>
“Because that’s just where we are now, and time doesn’t move forward in the In‐Between, no matter what anyone believes. The In-Between is a place to travel between times, not to have experiences. It is better to leave as soon as possible.”
<br><br>
The world slowly blurs back to complete white. Limoges waves goodbye while fading away.
