    Etigeox: Downfall is a non-canonical tale of the Etigeox Universe set after a disastrous end to the Second Etigeox War in 2045.
    The Etigeox Federation has fallen far from grace, going from occupying half of North America to being pushed back to its inner provinces.
    High Command in the capital is under pressure of keeping up the fight while the government is split between numerous factions due to the 
    devastation of the war.
