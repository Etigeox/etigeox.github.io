            <h2>Etigeox Unleashed</h2>
            <h5>"Armageddon and Amalgamation"</h5>

            <p>Etigeox: Unleashed is a non-canonical tale of the Etigeox Universe set after a disastrous end to the
                Second Etigeox War (or World War Three). <br><br> Nearing the downfall, the Premier Overseer of the Etigeox
                Federation authorizes a plan to shift the tectonic plates in a last ditch attempt to destablize the
                world. The Ministry of Defence of the Federation launches several Etigeum ICBM strikes on the Eurasian
                Union and NATO, resulting in nuclear and Etigeum armageddon. The artificial lives once loyal to humanity
                have turned their backs on them after being witness to mankind's pure madness. Ocean levels rise as
                climate change is definitely worsened. The ERF, nearing the end of the world decides that they might as
                well unleash an uncontrollable zombie bio-weapon upon the world, along with Assimilation.<br><br>

                In Northern Quebec, a small group of survivors issued from the fallen Etigeox Federation is trying to
                survive. In the background, a scientist named Elise is brewing something terrible with technology left
                behind by a certain Henry Carthage.</p>
