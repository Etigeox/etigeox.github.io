    <h1>Flip Tales</h1>
<p><i>"From origin springs the tapestry of existence."</i><br><br>
    Flip is a story set before the mainline Pillars. The main concept of Flip is around the Flipwatches, a magical item which provides every person
    possessing it with their own pocket dimension based on their heart and mind. Many gods and goddesses are in a struggle for power while the End of All slowly draws near.
