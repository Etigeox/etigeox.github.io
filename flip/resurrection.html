    Flip: Resurrection is a non-canonical story set before the events of Flip. The declining empire of Zentrum, hit extremely hard by Athifaenos's
    skirmishes and half of Ther Island sinking, wishes to regain favour from the gods, providing a party which would be known as God's Chosen Party
    to participate in the Godly Civil War. After the Great Nether God was finally defeated by God's Chosen Party, their leader was cursed to fall as well.
    Resurrected, the leader finds herself in the enemy camp and the entire empire after them.
